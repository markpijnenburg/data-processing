##### Summary
Loads temperature data via XMLHTTPRequest and plots this via pure JavaScript to a line graph. I used the average daytemperature for the complete year 2016.

### Week 3
#### Interactive barchart with D3

Assignment: Implement an interactive barchart using D3. No other libraries then D3 are allowed.

##### Summary
Barchart is based on the number of casualities in the last 50 years from mass shootings in the USA. The data is loaded via a JSON file. I also implemented the D3 tooltip as an interactive part. Outside of the assignment, I animated the barchart a little bit with the built-in ease function.

### Week 4
#### D3 Scatterplot

Assignment: Create a scatterplot visualization of data using the D3 library. Add a legend using SVG.

##### Summary
The scatterplot is based on data from the Happy Planet Index. It shows the average life expectancy versus the happiness of people from countries around the world. The size of the dots in the scatterplot indicates the ecological footprint of that country. For more information about how the data is gathered and calculated, please see [https://happyplanetindex.org](https://happyplanetindex.org).

### Week 5
#### D3 Multi-line Chart

Assignment: Create a multi-line chart in D3 based on you own dataset. The chart should contain a interactive component such as a crosshair, that shows the specific values for each line when hovering.

##### Summary
This multi-line chart is based on the stock data of a few tech companies, Microsoft, Netflix and Apple. The data is plotted into the chart, where the user is able to choose which year is displayed. Currently the chart contains data from 2015 and 2016.
